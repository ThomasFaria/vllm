# A LLM-serving library based on vLLM

## Description

This project proposes helm charts deployment for llm use and serving. 
It is based on the library and docker package [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).

**This project is heavily WIP and might be subject to changes and bugs.**

This project aims to be developed on [Onyxia](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/) but should be general enough that it can be adapted to other platforms.
